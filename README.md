ðŸ’¡ Three-Phase Inverter Using 8051 Microcontroller â€“ Proteus Simulation
This project showcases the simulation of a three-phase voltage source inverter controlled by an 8051 microcontroller (AT89S52). It effectively converts DC input into a three-phase AC output using MOSFETs and is perfect for learning or demonstrating the basics of microcontroller-based power conversion.

ðŸ”§ Components Used:
8051 Microcontroller (AT89S52) â€“ Generates PWM signals for inverter control.

BC547 Transistors (Q1â€“Q6) â€“ Work as driver amplifiers for the MOSFETs.

IRFZ44N MOSFETs (Q7â€“Q12) â€“ Switch DC power in a 3-phase bridge configuration.

Three-Phase Transformer (Delta/Star) â€“ For waveform transformation and visualization.

Virtual Oscilloscope â€“ To observe the three-phase AC waveforms.

12V DC Supply â€“ Powers the entire inverter circuit.

Display and Input Controls â€“ Used for basic user interface and debugging.

ðŸŒ€ Working Principle:
The microcontroller generates a sequence of pulses to simulate a three-phase signal. These are amplified by NPN transistor stages and used to switch the MOSFETs accordingly. The result is a simulated three-phase AC output which can be viewed on the oscilloscope. The transformer configuration helps in waveform stabilization and phase separation.

âœ… Features:
Simple and educational circuit for learning inverter logic

Suitable for BLDC or induction motor simulations
